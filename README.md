## Project Overview
This repository contains the code, report, and presentation for the IPE project **"Brain MRI Tumor Detection"**. The goal is to build and evaluate deep learning models to classify MRI brain images into **Tumor** and **No Tumor** categories, and to discuss clinical relevance and limitations.

Key highlights:
- Data preprocessing & augmentation
- Baseline model (Logistic Regression)
- Custom CNN model (best recall for tumor detection)
- Transfer learning experiments (EfficientNetB0 / ResNet50)
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Visualizations: confusion matrix, ROC curve, Grad-CAM
